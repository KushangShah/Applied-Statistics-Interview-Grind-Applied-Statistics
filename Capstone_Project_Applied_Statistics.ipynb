        "Testing the goodness of fit of a discrete probability distribution involves assessing how well a theoretical distribution, often assumed to be a specific probability distribution (e.g., the binomial, Poisson, or geometric distribution), fits the observed data. The goal is to determine whether the observed data follows the theoretical distribution or whether there are significant discrepancies. Several statistical tests can be used for this purpose, depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the data. Here are some common methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test:**\n",
        "   - The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is a widely used method to test whether observed data follows a specific discrete probability distribution.\n",
        "   - The test involves comparing the observed frequencies (counts) of each outcome or category with the expected frequencies that would be obtained under the theoretical distribution.\n",
        "   - The test statistic is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, scaled by the expected frequencies and degrees of freedom.\n",
        "   - The chi-square test statistic follows a chi-square distribution, and you can calculate a p-value to assess the goodness of fit. If the p-value is sufficiently large (typically above a chosen significance level), you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a good fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:**\n",
        "   - The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test assesses the goodness of fit by comparing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed data with the CDF of the theoretical distribution.\n",
        "   - The test statistic measures the maximum absolute difference between the two CDFs.\n",
        "   - The critical values of the KS test statistic can be obtained from tables or computed for a chosen significance level.\n",
        "   - If the test statistic is smaller than the critical value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a good fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Anderson-Darling Test:**\n",
        "   - The Anderson-Darling test is similar to the KS test but places more emphasis on differences in the tails of the distributions.\n",
        "   - It uses a weighted sum of squared differences between observed and expected cumulative distribution functions.\n",
        "   - Critical values for the Anderson-Darling test statistic can also be obtained for a chosen significance level.\n",
        "   - A small test statistic suggests a good fit to the theoretical distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Graphical Methods:**\n",
        "   - Visual inspection of quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and probability plots can provide insights into the goodness of fit. These plots compare the quantiles of the observed data with the quantiles of the theoretical distribution. A straight line in the plot suggests a good fit.\n",
        "   \n",
        "When performing goodness-of-fit tests, it's essential to specify the theoretical distribution you are testing against and choose an appropriate significance level (alpha) for your test. Additionally, be aware that a significant result doesn't necessarily imply a poor fit; it may indicate that the sample size is large enough to detect minor discrepancies.\n",
        "\n",
