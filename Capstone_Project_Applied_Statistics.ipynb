Percentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within a dataset, showing the percentage of data below that value. Quartiles divide data into four equal parts, providing insights into the spread and center of the data. In a test score dataset, the 75th percentile (3rd quartile) marks the score below which 75% of the scores fall. Quartiles help identify the median (2nd quartile) and the spread of the middle 50% of the data (interquartile range)."
